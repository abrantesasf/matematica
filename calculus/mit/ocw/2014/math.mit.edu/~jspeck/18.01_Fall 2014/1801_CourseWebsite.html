        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>This course covers differential and integral calculus for a function of a single variable including some applications. This roughly corresponds to the first 13 chapters of the text.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="ps"><strong> For a detailed syllabus, see the &quot;Syllabus&quot; link at the top	of the page. The detailed syllabus will most likely evolve as the semester progresses. You are encouraged to do the reading listed on the syllabus </strong>before class.</p>

        <hr class="dotted" />
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><strong>Grades</strong></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Your final grade will be determined by a weighted average of your</strong> homework, 4 midterms,<strong> and a </strong>final<strong>.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Your homework is due every Friday 15 minutes before the start of class. The homework should be turned in at the Pset boxes outside of room E17-131. </strong>This is the only valid method of turning in homework for this course.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>There are absolutely no deadline extensions for homework.<strong> If you have any problems, then talk to your recitation instructor. They may offer to fill in any missing grades with the average of your other homework scores. They may offer other remedies. You are responsible for trying to make such arrangements; if you don't make any arrangements, then any missing scores will count as a 0 in the calculuation of your final course grade.</strong> <strong>You will receive an official email from your recitation instructor confirming any arrangements.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Collaboration is permitted, but your final version must be written in your own words and you must fully understand everything you have written.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It is illegal to consult any sources for the homework. <strong>This includes solutions from previous years, the internet, textbooks, journal articles, etc. The only exception to this rule is the Supplemenatary Notes, which you are encouraged to use.</strong></p>

          <li>
            <p><strong>There will be four written midterm exams: </strong>September 26, October 17, November 07, <strong>and</strong> November <strong>21.</strong><strong> Each midterm will last 50 minutes.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>There will be a 3 hour written final exam. The final will be scheduled by the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/registrar/classrooms/exams/finals/index.html"><u>Registrar</u></a>.</strong></p>

          <li>

          <li>
            <p> Midterm policies<strong>: If you fail a midterm, you will be notified,   and you can take the makeup midterm to increase  your score. If you fail, then you can sign up for a makeup midterm by clicking <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1U0iOKupoBZ8uIInvNRfJnhM4lxUQ-QfEcIMn0mStdHI/viewform">here</a>. </strong>The makeup midterm is offered only once for each exam<strong>, and only at a  specified date and time. Taking the makeup cannot decrease your   given score, but can only increase it to the minimum passing level (any   points beyond the minimum passing score will be discarded). Usually,   the same policy holds if you did not attend the midterm and do not have a valid   reason. The course policy is that</strong> you cannot take any midterm, or any makeup midterm, at a date besides the official date and time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>If you have any problems with  midterms or midterm scheduling, contact your recitation instructor </strong>and CC Professor Speck<strong>. It is your responsibility to do so if there are any problems.You will receive an official email from the recitation instructor confirming any arrangements.</strong></p>
