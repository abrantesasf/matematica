00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250


1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,520
We know that limits might not exist,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,700
and they might not exist in a variety of ways.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,000
It could blow up to infinity or it could blow up

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,830
to minus infinity.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,680
Or there could be some other reason, like the function just

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,940
goes crazy.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,830
So far, we've lumped all of these scenarios

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,790
under the label of DNE.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,120
But sometimes, like when you're graphing a function,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,310
you don't just want to know that a limit doesn't exist.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,000
You want to know in what way it doesn't exist.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,750
So that's what this short section is going to be about.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's take the function 1 over x.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,080
And let's suppose we want its limit as x approaches 0

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,915
from the right.

16
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:52,530


17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,320
Now, as x approaches 0, the denominator is approaching 0.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,710
And this numerator, well, that's 1.

19
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,630
So it's not approaching 0.

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,010
And that means the second part of the division limit law

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,490
is going to tell us that this limit does not exist.

22
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,110
But does not exist in what way?

23
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,380
The limit law doesn't tell us that.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,550
So let's investigate.

25
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,360
So our numerator is always 1.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,150
And as x approaches 0 from the right,

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,890
the denominator is positive and getting really, really small.

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:36,125
So we're going to get things like 1 over 0.01, 1 over 0.001,

29
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:41,200
1 over 0.0001, et cetera.

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,000
And these fractions are 100, 1,000, 10,000.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,920
So as x is going to 0 from the right, 1 over x is blowing up.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,250
And its graph is going to be looking

33
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:01,320
like this, with this vertical asymptote at x equals 0.

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,950
So that's what's going on.

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,510
And when a function blows up like this,

36
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,450
we'll write that the limit is plus infinity.

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,900
And that just means that the limit does not

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,100
exist because it blows up in the positive direction, hence

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,525
the plus infinity.

40
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:25,160


41
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,370
If a function's limit doesn't exist because the function

42
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,100
blows up in the opposite direction,

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,350
then we'll say that the limit is minus infinity.

44
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,470
So we have some problems for you so

45
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,160
that you can play around and get comfortable with this.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:49,529
