00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580


1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,440
At this point you can recognize properties

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,590
of a function's derivative and second derivative

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,120
by looking at its graph.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,720
In this section we are doing the reverse.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,450
Using information about the function and its derivatives,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,840
we can sketch a graph that captures

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,880
all the salient features.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,190
This sketch might not be to scale, but that is OK.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,690
We just want to get the general idea of the function, thinking

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,580
of it as a curve, without getting

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,729
stuck on the actual values.

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,770
Warning.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,270
Your common sense is going to be the main ingredient.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,590
So don't forget your pre-calculus skills.
