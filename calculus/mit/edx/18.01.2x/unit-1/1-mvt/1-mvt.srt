2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,826
How you doing today, sir?

3
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:20,325
Hi.

4
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,310
Can I see your license and registration please?

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,320
What was I doing?

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,370
Speeding.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,300
I was?

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,090
Yes, you were.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,110
How do you know I was speeding?

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,360
You're looking a little tired.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,820
How long you've driving today?

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,260
Maybe two hours.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,520
We did you come from?

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
New Jersey.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,120
How far away is New Jersey?

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,400
170 miles.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,270
So 170 miles divided by 2 is 85 miles an hour, sir.

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,190
Isn't that a little fast?

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,710
OK.

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,054
So you knew my average speed was 85,

21
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:47,970
but how do you know there was an incident when

22
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,320
I was traveling at 85?

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,860
Sir, it's simple math.

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,880
The mean value theorem states that one moment

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,460
your instantaneous speed is going

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,520
to match your average speed.

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,220
You got me.

28
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,720
OK.

29
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,770
Can I have that license and registration now, sir?

30
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:13,350
