00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,810


1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,770
Here is the conclusion of the mean value theorem

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,630
that we have already seen.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,070
There is some point c, between and b, at which the tangent is

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,710
parallel to the secant.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,900
You have just seen that this statement

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,100
holds for some functions, but doesn't for some others.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,720
So what are conditions that will guarantee

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,110
that the MVT conclusion holds?

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,620


10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,120
Let us investigate the examples from the problem you just

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,070
solved.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,890
We have collected the successful functions,

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,350
the ones for which the MVT conclusion hold,

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,930
on the top row, and the failures,

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,273
on the bottom two rows.

16
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:50,810


17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,379
We will start by discussing why the functions in the middle row

18
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:54,878
fail.

19
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,000


20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,842
Let us look at the first graph.

21
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:04,940


22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,610
For the first graph, we can shift the secant line

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,060
to approach a point where it is tangent to our graph.

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,160
But we find that the exact point that this would have happened

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,101
is a point where the function is undefined.

26
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:22,870


27
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,240
So there is no c.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,830


29
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,270
Next, let's look at the second graph in the middle row.

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,930
It has a jump discontinuity at an endpoint.

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,480


32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:47,460
The secant line slants down, but all the tangent lines slant up,

33
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,950
so there is no c.

34
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,650


35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,390
Because of the discontinuity, there

36
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,020
is no relationship between the slope of the secant

37
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,436
and the slope of the tangents.

38
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:02,820


39
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,030
Similarly, for the rest of the graphs in this row,

40
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,340
the reason that the MVT conclusion fails

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,480
is a discontinuity either at an endpoint

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,910
or within the interval.

43
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:25,470


44
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,300
Let's look at the bottom row now.

45
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,540
Each of these two graphs is continuous

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,350
but has a point within the interval where

47
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,020
the derivative does not exist.

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,780
In the first, there is a corner, and in the second,

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,774
there is a cusp.

50
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:52,920


51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,760
You can check that the reason there

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,790
is no tangent parallel to the secant

53
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,496
is because of the point where the function is not

54
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:01,121
differentiable.

55
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:06,740


56
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,020
Let us now look at the successful functions.

57
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,400
We can use the same method as before

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,367
to find a point at which the tangent is parallel

59
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:16,950
to the secant.

60
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,060


61
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,280
We see that the first four graphs on this row

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,858
have hump shapes at whose peaks the c's appear.

63
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:30,630


64
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,580
On the other hand, the last function on this row

65
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,090
is equal to the secant line, so at every point,

66
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,210
the tangent is also equal to the secant line.

67
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,248
In other words, every point within the interval is a c.

68
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:51,920


69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,080
What do all these graphs have in common?

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,146
Well, all of these graphs are continuous and differentiable.

71
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:06,500


72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,330
Let's return to our question, what condition on a function

73
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,289
will guarantee that the MVT conclusion holds?

74
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,640


75
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,180
We already see that continuity and differentiability

76
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,680
are conditions that will include all

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,420
of our examples of successes, and exclude

78
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,390
all of our cases of failures.

79
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,800
It turns out that continuity and differentiability are

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,410
enough to guarantee success.

81
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,250


82
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,891
So let us state the mean value theorem precisely.

83
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:48,640


84
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,030
If a function x of t is continuous

85
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,850
on the closed interval a to b, and

86
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,120
differentiable on the open interval a to b,

87
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,450
then there is some point c in the open interval

88
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:14,260
a to b such that the average rate of change from a to b

89
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,301
is equal to the instantaneous rate of change at c.

90
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:23,020


91
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,640
Let's write this conclusion in terms of formulas

92
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,220
now rather than words.

93
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,180


94
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,650
The average rate of change from a to b

95
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:40,384
is equal to x of b minus x of a, divided by b minus a.

96
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:43,060
And the instantaneous rate of change

97
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,054
at c is equal to x prime of c.

98
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:51,440


99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,990
Notice in the hypothesis the function

100
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,815
needs to be continuous on the closed interval, including

101
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:02,210
the endpoints, but needs to be differentiable only

102
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,190
on the open interval.

103
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,364
So the derivative does not have to exist for the endpoints.

104
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:11,210


105
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,530
Let us now do some exercises.

106
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,830
And we will continue with some immediate consequences

107
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,610
of the MVT.

108
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:26,959
