00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,510
Welcome to the second part of our calculus class.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,230
We will start with the mean value theorem,

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,720
and may call it the MVT from now on.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,620


5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,160
The mean value theorem relates the average rate of change

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,920
and the instantaneous rate of change of a function.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,990


8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,450
In more detail, consider a function

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,190
x of t, over an interval a to b, so that the endpoints are

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:43,030
a, x of a and b, x of b.

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,090
Recall the average rate of change of the function

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,070
x of t over the interval a to b is geometrically

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,160
the slope of the secant line through the two endpoints.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,070


15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,620
Recall also that the instantaneous rate

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,319
of change of the function x of t,

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:09,790
at a point t1 between a and b, is geometrically

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,100
the slope of the tangent line at t1.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,480


20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,375
Notice the average rate of change is only one number,

21
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,730
but the instantaneous rate of change

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,380
can take different values at different points

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,235
within the interval.

24
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:29,800


25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,390
So how does the mean value theorem relate to these two?

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,920
Well, as you will see on our graph,

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,420
there is a point at which the tangent

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,120
is parallel, in other words, has the same slope

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,630
as the secant line.

30
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,630
Let us find such a point now.

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,340
We can shift the secant line without changing its slope

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,910
until it is tangent to our graph.

33
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,540
And here it is at a point at which the tangent is parallel

34
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,200
to the secant.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,960
And we will call this point c.

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,020


37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,730
So the following is the conclusion

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,400
of the mean value theorem.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,520


40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,870
There is some point c, in between the endpoints a

41
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,470
and b, such that the average rate of change from a to b

42
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,325
is equal to the instantaneous rate of change at c.

43
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,540


44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,850
Or again, geometrically, there is some point c, in between a

45
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,740
and b, such that the slope of the secant line through the two

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,255
endpoints is equal to the slope of the tangent line at c.

47
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:55,130


48
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,740
Notice the MVT says that such a c is strictly

49
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,920
in between the endpoints, but it does not

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,500
say where exactly such a c is, or even

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,330
how many such c's there are.

52
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,210
In fact, there are two such c's in our example.

53
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,620


54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,870
We have only talked about the conclusion of the mean value

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,160
theorem.

56
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,760
But what about the hypothesis?

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,010
In other words, when does it hold?

58
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,130
To find out when the theorem holds,

59
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,500
let us now explore when it fails.

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,421
