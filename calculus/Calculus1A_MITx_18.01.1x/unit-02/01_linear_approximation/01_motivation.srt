One of the main skills that you will learn in this unit
is the ability to differentiate any function
you will encounter, no matter how complicated.
The simplest possible function is a line.
One of the main features of calculus
is that it allows us to use tangent lines
to understand even the most complicated function.
We think of the tangent line as a linear approximation
to the function near a point.
This approximation is extremely valuable,
both computationally and conceptually.
