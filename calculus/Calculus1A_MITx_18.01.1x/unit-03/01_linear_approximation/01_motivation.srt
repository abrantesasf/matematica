Engineers are interested in understanding
how small changes in a system affect its performance.
For example, zip lines have become popular
all over the world, and it's imperative
that operators control the speed of the rider.
Not only do they want to make sure
that riders don't go too fast, they also
want to prevent them from getting stuck in the middle.
To adjust the speed, operators will raise or lower
the starting point of the zip line
by a matter of centimeters.
How do we estimate the effect of small changes like this?
The key tool is linear approximation, which we'll
learn about in this sequence.
