00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850


1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,910
In this sequence, we'll be developing ways

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,780
to use the derivative of a function, f,

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,770
to get information about the shape of the graph of f.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,580
For instance, we know that if f prime

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,430
is positive on interval a comma b,

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,600
then f is going to be increasing on that interval.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,430
And if f prime is negative between a and b,

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,960
then f is decreasing on that interval.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,280
We've seen this before.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,120
But let's use this to figure out some things about the graph.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,520
So for instance, maybe f of x is the function 1 plus

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,870
4x minus x cubed over 3.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,640
And here, f prime of x is 4 minus x squared.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
And we can tell when this is positive

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,110
and when it's negative.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,170
The derivative is positive when x squared is less than 4.

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,730
And that happens when x is between 2 and minus 2,

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,170
so on the interval minus 2 to 2.

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,140
And the derivative is negative when

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,810
x squared is greater than 4.

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,520
So that's on the intervals from minus infinity to minus 2

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,535
and from 2 to infinity.

23
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:22,260


24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,450
So between x equals minus 2 and x equals plus 2,

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,280
f is going to be increasing.

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
So its graph will look something like this.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,150
Whereas, to the left of minus 2, the graph will be decreasing,

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,890
and also to the right of plus 2.

29
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,900
So there we have it.

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,420


31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,730
Now, this doesn't tell us everything

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,650
we might want to know about the graph.

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,430
We don't know where it crosses the x-axis.

34
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,580
We don't know how high this point is,

35
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,100
or this point where the graph turns around, in other words.

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,470
But those things we can get with algebra.

37
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,549
The calculus does give us a good sense of the overall shape

38
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,090
of the graph.

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,370
And that's definitely useful.

40
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,550
As we go forward, we're going to develop more and more language

41
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,000
which we can use to describe various features of graphs.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,110
And for each of them, we'll see how calculus

43
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,220
can be used to find them.

44
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,950
Sound good?

45
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,921
