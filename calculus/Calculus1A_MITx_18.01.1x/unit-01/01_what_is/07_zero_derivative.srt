00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,670


1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,160
We've calculated f prime of 2 to be 0 meters per second.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,140
But what does that mean?

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,130
Should we interpret it as saying that the pumpkin froze

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,260
in midair?

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,950
Well, no.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,270
We know that pumpkins don't behave like that.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,690
Freezing in midair would require the velocity of the pumpkin

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,270
to be 0 over a period of time.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,780
But what we have is a derivative.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,490
That's an instantaneous velocity.

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,290
So it's a velocity only at the instant t equals 2 seconds.

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,170
To think about it a different way,

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,770
we know that a positive derivative

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,980
means that f is increasing.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,870
So the velocity would be upward.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,690
A negative derivative means that the velocity would be downward.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,400
There's an instant, however, in between.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,750
Right at the time the pumpkin reaches

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,000
the top of its trajectory.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,330
The pumpkin has stopped going up.

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,770
But it hasn't quite started to go down.

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,600
And it's right at that moment that we

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,780
say that the instantaneous velocity is 0.

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,655
